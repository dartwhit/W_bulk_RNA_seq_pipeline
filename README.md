# W_bulk_RNA_seq_pipeline

A Snakemake-based pipeline for preprocessing, quality control, alignment, quantification, and transformation of bulk RNA-seq data. This pipeline is designed for flexibility and reproducibility, supporting both single-end and paired-end reads and producing normalized count matrices ready for downstream analysis.

## ðŸ§¬ Features

- Download and organize raw FASTQ files
- Quality control with FastQC and MultiQC
- Adapter trimming and deduplication using Fastp
- Alignment using HISAT2
- Gene-level quantification with FeatureCounts
- Aggregation and transformation of expression data (TPM, log2TPM, VST)
- Configurable support for single- or paired-end reads

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io)
- Python â‰¥ 3.8
- External tools:
  - `fastqc`
  - `fastp`
  - `multiqc`
  - `hisat2`
  - `samtools`
  - `featureCounts` (from Subread)
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy` (used in `aggregate_counts.py`)
